# URI Online Judge

My solutions to URI Online Judge problems.

I'm using the problems to study Test Driven Development (TDD) and PEP8.
So I'm not just solving them but creating tests and working with functions
and/or classes. Then solutions might be a little longer than usual because
I'm not trying to solve the problems in the minimum number of lines.
